# create_Venv
Script that creates virtual environment for python. 

I needed a faster way to create a project with a list of required depencies for easier documentation. 
To use, simply add location to your "Path" variable, then use the syntax in cmd:

create_venv -projectName "replace_With_Project_Name"

This will add a requirements.txt file along with a git repository. 

If you need an easier to remember command, simply change the name of the batch file. 

The ability to activate and deactivate the virtual environment from the root folder was added.
This is done through the command "manage_venv [activate / deactivate]

I hope this simple script offers as much utility to you as it does to me.
