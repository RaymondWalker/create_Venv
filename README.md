# create_Venv
Script that creates virtual environment for python. 

I needed a faster way to create a project with a list of required depencies for easier documentation. 
To use, simply add to your "Path" variable, then use the syntax in cmd

create_venv -projectName "replace_With_Project_Name"

This will add a requirements.txt file along with a git repository. 

I hope this simple script offers as much utility to you as it does to me.
